To run it locally, follow these steps:PrerequisitesXAMPP (or similar LAMP/WAMP stack like Laragon or MAMP)PHP 8.0 or higherMySQL 5.7 or higherInstallation Steps1. Clone or Download the ProjectPlace the farmstat-main folder directly into your XAMPP's web directory (usually C:\xampp\htdocs\):Bash# Place the farmstat-main folder in your XAMPP htdocs directory
C:\xampp\htdocs\farmstat-main\
2. Start XAMPP ServicesOpen your XAMPP Control Panel and ensure both Apache and MySQL services are running.3. Create the DatabaseOpen phpMyAdmin in your browser: http://localhost/phpmyadmin/Import the provided database schema file: farmstats_db.sqlThis creates the database (farmstats_db) and populates it with sample user data (Admin/Farmer).4. Configure the Database ConnectionYou must edit the database credentials in the main configuration file:Open the file: app/config/config.phpEdit the lines for your database connection details:PHP// Database configuration
define('DB_HOST', '127.0.0.1:3306');  // Change port if needed (e.g., to 3325)
define('DB_NAME', 'farmstats_db');
define('DB_USER', 'root');           // Default XAMPP user
define('DB_PASS', '');               // Default XAMPP password (often blank)
Note: If your MySQL port is not the standard 3306, you must change it here (e.g., to 127.0.0.1:3325).5. Access the ApplicationOpen your web browser and navigate to the project's URL:http://localhost/farmstat-main/
You should now see the landing page.🏗️ Application Architecture (MVC)The project follows a strong Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for better scalability and maintainability:ComponentDirectoryFunctionControllersapp/controllers/Process user input, handle business logic, and route requests (e.g., AuthController.php, AdminController.php).Modelsapp/models/Handle data operations and database interactions (e.g., User.php, Farmer.php).Viewsapp/views/Present data to users with clean HTML templates (e.g., auth/login.php, dashboard/admin.php).Coreapp/core/Contains base classes for the framework, including the custom Router.php for clean URL handling.Entry Pointindex.phpThe single point of entry for all application requests, managed by the router.Key ImprovementsClean URLs: Uses a custom router and an .htaccess file for friendly URLs (e.g., /login, /admin/users).Separation of Concerns: Logic, presentation, and data are strictly isolated.Role-Based Security: Authentication and access control are handled at the controller level.👥 User Roles & Sample CredentialsThe application is set up with two primary roles for testing:RoleEmailPasswordAccess LevelAdminadmin@farmstat.compasswordFull system management (User, Farmer, Campaign CRUD)Farmerfarmer@farmstat.compasswordPersonal dashboard, seasonal tracking, community features
